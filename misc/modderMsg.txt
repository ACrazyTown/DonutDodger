wassup

i made the music loading dynamic and its sick and awesome and that means you can have 
CUSTOM MUSIC baby!!!

all you need to do for custom music is 
- place a music file in "assets/music" (.ogg for desktop and .mp3 for web, or both for both)
- open "assets/data/songList.txt" and add your song info with the format it uses:

[SONG NAME]:[AUTHOR]:[FILENAME without (.ogg/.mp3) e.g. 'mycoolsong.mp3' would be 'mycoolsong']:[SONG BPM]

and thats it!!!
it should work
if it doesnt... uhhhh like report an issue or something
ok bye bye
